### I. Overview

#### 1. What's Design Pattern

- solutions to general problems developers facing during software development
- obtained by trial and error by numerous developers over quite a substantial period of time

#### 2. What is Gang of Four (GoF)?

- in 1994, four authors (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) published a book titled **Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** which initiated the concept of Design Pattern
- These authors are collectively known as **Gang of Four**. According to these authors, design patterns are primarily based on following principles of object oriented design
  - Program to an interface not an implementation
  - Favor object composition over inheritance

#### 3. What is the usage of Design Pattern

There are two main usages : 

- **Common platform for developers**
  - provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example : a **singleton design pattern** signifies use of single object, developer can tell each other it's following a singleton pattern.
- **Best Practice**
  - design patterns have been evolved over a long time, they provide best solutions to certain problems faced during software development.

#### 4. What are the types of Design Patterns

According to GoF, there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories : **Creational, Structural and Behavioral Patterns**. 

And some other category of design pattern : **J2EE Design Pattern**

| Pattern                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Creational Patterns**  | 1. provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator<br/>2. This gives program flexibility in deciding which object need to be created for a given usage.<br/>3. Examples :   Factory, Builder |
| **Structural Patterns**  | 1. concern class and object composition.<br/>2. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities<br/>3. Example : Adapter, Bridge |
| **Behavioral  Patterns** | 1. specifically concerned with communication between objects<br/>2. Example : |
| **J2EE Patterns**        | 1. specifically concerned with the presentation tier.        |
